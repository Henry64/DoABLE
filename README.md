# DoABLE (End-to-End Feasibility)
The phrase "Make everything feasible" is used to describe a solution designed to develop an industrial plan within a specific time horizon, clearly defining commercial targets.

This plan is then atomized into its principal components using simplified Bills of Materials (BOMs) to explode the first-level 'buy' requirements.

The explosion of second-level requirements and beyond is requested and activated by the entire supply pipeline, ensuring end-to-end feasibility (from the first to the very last component).

This comprehensive approach allows all supply chain actors, along with the Final Customer, to gain full visibility and control over potential risks and the recalibration of projected delivery dates.
